    Currently, most of biological modelizations use a trait-based model; but that need a lot of knowledges about modelized system.\\
    \vspace{7pt}\\
    \textsc{Probabilities On Genetic Graph} (POGG) is another model, designed for patterns finding and metabolic network modelizing, based on measurement of studied variables~\cite{JBourdon2011}.\\
    \vspace{7pt}\\
    Here, POGG is used for study\\the Nitrification process\\
    of Nitrogen cycle.

            POGG use Markov chains, probabilities\\matrix and cost matrix,

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Trait-based models are commonly used for system modelizations, but need a perfect knowledge of the system, like enzymatic reactions for a metabolic model.\\
    \vspace{7pt}\\
    Stochastic and quantitativ modelizations like POGG allow creation of models, only by\\
    observation of its behavior in the learning step.\\
    \vspace{7pt}\\
    However, it preserves and intensifies bias in learning data; moreover, if it can be theoretically applied to all systems, POGG can't quickly modelize those with a too great number of reaction.
